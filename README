First attempt at a small Android App.
You can enter GPS coordinates and create a geofence with a radius of 50m around that location. 
As soon as you enter the geofence, the phone will vibrate for 10s. Then location updates will be used to track your movement inside the geofence. 
If you move towards the center, the background color will turn green. 
If you move away from the center, it will turn red. 
If you remain at the same distance it will turn yellow.
When you exit the geofence the phone will vibrate for 5s and the constant location updates stop.
